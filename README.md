# Maven-Fuzzy-Factory-Project-2

By now, Maven Fuzzy Factory has been in the market for 3 years and has generated enough growth to raise a much larger round of venture capital funding. The CEO, Cindy Sharp, is close to securing the company’s next round of funding, and she needs your help to tell a compelling story to investors. You will need to pull the relevant data and help Cindy to craft a story about a data-driven company that has been producing rapid growth.


The following are the requests she would like you to do:

* First, I’d like to show our volume growth. Can you pull **overall session and order volume, trended by quarter** for the life of the business? Since the most recent quarter is incomplete, you can decide how to handle it.

* Next, let’s showcase all of our efficiency improvements. I would love to show **quarterly figures** since we launched, for **session-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order, and revenue per session**.

* I’d like to show how we’ve grown specific channels. Could you pull a **quarterly view of orders** from **Gsearch nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search, and direct type-in**?

* Next, let’s show the overall **session-to-order conversion rate trends** for those same channels, **by quarter**. Please also make a note of any periods where we made major improvements or optimizations.

* We’ve come a long way since the days of selling a single product. Let’s pull **monthly trending for revenue and margin by product, along with total sales and revenue**. Note anything you notice about seasonality.

* Let’s dive deeper into the impact of introducing new products. Please pull monthly sessions to the /products page, and show how **the % of those sessions clicking through another page** has changed over time, along with a view of how **conversion from /products to placing an order** has improved.

* We made our 4th product available as a primary product on December 05, 2014 (it was previously only a cross-sell item). Could you please pull sales data since then, and show how well **each product cross-sells from one another**?
